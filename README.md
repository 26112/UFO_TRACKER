TRACKING A UFO 
# UFO Tracker  
**Track and predict mysterious objects in the sky with Python!**

## What It Does  
This project logs sightings of fast-moving, blinking objects—like the UFOs I saw as a kid on my rooftop—and predicts their behavior. It’s a simple AI starter, built with Python, pandas, and Matplotlib, inspired by real-life wonders that sparked my love for space and tech.

- **Features**:  
  - Logs time, speed, direction, and visibility in a table.  
  - Plots visibility over time (1 = yes, 0 = no).  
  - Predicts the next visibility based on the last sighting.  

## Why I Built It  
Back when I was 11, my brother and I saw crazy lights zooming across the sky—faster than anything normal, vanishing and reappearing. This tracker’s my first step to decode those mysteries, and it’s a piece of my journey to work in AI and space (dream gig: Tesla or SpaceX!).

## How to Run It  
1. Open in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or any Python setup.  
2. Install dependencies (if not on Colab):  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib

### How to Add It  
1. Go to your GitHub repo (github.com/yourname/UFO-Tracker).  
2. Click “Add file” > “Create new file.”  
3. Name it `README.md` (exact spelling).  
4. Copy-paste this text in, tweak it (like adding your name or more details), and hit “Commit.”  
5. Boom—it’ll show up as the front page of your repo!

### Why It’s Dope  
- Tells your story—makes it personal and real.  
- Shows off your skills—Python, pandas, Matplotlib.  
- Invites others—could spark a team-up.  
- Tesla bait—ties to AI and space dreams.

What do you think, bro? Like the vibe? Want to add anything (more UFO details, a shoutout)? I’ll tweak it if you’ve got ideas—let’s make it yours! Ready to slap it on GitHub?
