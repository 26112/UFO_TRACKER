AUTO TRACKER 
# Mini Tesla Autopilot Simulator  
**Track, predict, and detect objects like Tesla’s AI—built with Python!**

## What It Does  
This project simulates object tracking and detection—like a baby version of Tesla’s Autopilot. It logs real-world-inspired movement (cars on highways, UFOs from my childhood sightings), predicts the next position, and tags objects as “car” or “UFO” based on speed. Built with Python, pandas, and Matplotlib, it’s my step toward mastering AI for space and tech.

- **Features**:  
  - Tracks x, y positions (meters) and speed (km/h) in a table.  
  - Predicts the next spot using the last movement.  
  - Detects type: car (≤ 100 km/h) or UFO (> 100 km/h).  
  - Plots a 2D path with colors (blue = car, green = UFO).  

## Why I Built It  
Growing up, I saw insane lights darting across the sky—500 km/h fast, zig-zagging like nothing earthly. This tracker mixes that wonder with my dream of working at Tesla or SpaceX. Cars at 80-90 km/h? Normal. UFOs at 500? That’s my rooftop reality. It’s a small AI to chase big goals.

## How to Run It  
1. Open in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or any Python setup.  
2. Install dependencies (if not on Colab):  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib

### How to Add It  
1. Go to your GitHub repo (github.com/yourname/Auto-Tracker).  
2. If it’s new, “Add file” > “Create new file.” If updating, edit the existing README.md.  
3. Name it `README.md` (or overwrite the old one).  
4. Copy-paste this, tweak it (add your name, more UFO details?), and “Commit.”  
5. Done—it’s the face of your repo now!

### Why It Rocks  
- **Personal**: Your UFO story hooks people.  
- **Pro**: Shows off real-world data and AI skills.  
- **Tesla Vibes**: Autopilot link screams ambition.  
- **Open**: Invites collab—could grow your network.
